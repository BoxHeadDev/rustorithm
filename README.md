# Rustorithm

A collection of algorithms in Rust.

## Searching
Linear search
binary search
substring search (quadratic, Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt)
trie
Aho-Corasick

## Sorting
quadratic sorting (bubble, insertion)
quick sort
merge sort
heap sort

## Data Structures
### Arrays and Lists
growable array (aka ArrayList, vector)
doubly-linked list

### Heaps
binary heap

### Trees
binary search tree
avl tree
red-black tree
B-tree
splay tree
trie (also in search)

### Hash Tables
hash table (chaining and open addressing)

## Graph
### Traversal
depth first search (DFS)
breadth first search (BFS)

### Topological Processing
topological sort
strongly connected components

### Shortest Path
breadth first search (unweighted)
Dijkstra
Floyd-Warshall
Bellman-Ford

### Spanning Trees
Minimal spanning tree:
Prim's algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm

## dynamic programming
longest common subsequence
edit distance
